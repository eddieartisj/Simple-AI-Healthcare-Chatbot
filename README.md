# ü©∫ Simple AI Healthcare Chatbot

A basic AI-powered chatbot built with Python to assist users with general healthcare inquiries. This project demonstrates how rule-based logic and NLP techniques can simulate a healthcare assistant capable of answering questions about symptoms, conditions, and general wellness advice.

## üß† How It Works

This chatbot uses basic string matching and keyword analysis to determine the intent behind a user's input. The logic is structured with conditional statements and loops to provide a response that is contextually relevant.

Key components:
- `greetings`: Responds to greetings like "hi" or "hello"
- `symptoms_keywords`: Detects common symptom-related terms like "fever", "cough", or "headache"
- `emergency_keywords`: Triggers emergency responses when words like "emergency", "urgent", or "help" are mentioned
- `fallback_response`: Provides a general fallback when input is not recognized
